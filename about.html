        <p>I have a true love for the game of basketball and take care of my health and fitness by regularly going to the gym. Whether playing a pick-up game with friends or following the professional leagues, i have a deep appreciation for the sport and its players. My enthusiasm for basketball and commitment to fitness are contagious and enjoy sharing knowledge and insights with others. I might have a <strong>SLIGHT</strong> gambling problem!!

           As a Java programmer, I have a strong understanding of object-oriented programming principles and a passion for developing efficient and effective software solutions. I would like to master at least one programming language by the time I graduate!
